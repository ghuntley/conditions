Version [Version Number] ([Friendly Version Number]) [Release Date]

Version 1.0.3.0 (v1.0 beta 3) 2009-03-15
	General description:
		This released has some breaking changes to allow better support for languages other than C# (VB.NET
		for instance, wasn't supported well). Therefore, the old release is both binary and code incompatible.
		Still, C# users shouldn't expect to make any changes to their code.
	
	Bug Fixes:
		-Added an [Obsolete] attribute to the Equals(object) method of the Validator<T> class. The Equals 
		 method is not meant to be used by framework users and the compiler will now show a warning with the
		 message ''This method is not part of the validation framework. Please use the IsEqualTo method.' which
		 indicates clearly that the user should use the IsEqualTo method.	

	Code changes:
		-[BREAKING CHANGE] Entry point methods 'Requires' and 'Ensures' moved to a more meaningful class,
		 named 'Condition'. This leads to a more intuitive API for languages that do not support extension
		 methods on all type of objects such as VB.NET, which does not support extension methods on arguments
		 of the System.Object.


Version 1.0.2.0 (v1.0 beta 2) 2008-12-20
	General description:
		This release has several breaking changes. Therefore, the old release can not be swapped with this 
		release, without a recompilation. However, there is just one change in behavior users should pay
		attention to: The ValidatorExtension.IsOfType(Type) method now throws an Exception when the given
		argument is a null reference.

	Bug Fixes:
		-[BREAKING CHANGE] The ValidatorExtensions.IsOfType<T>(Type) method succeeded when the supplied value was
		 null. The method was actually written for the following typical use case:
			"if (!(param is Type)) throw new ArgumentException();". The use case would actually throw an
		 exception when 'param' is a null reference. The IsOfType<T> method now behaves correctly.

		-RequiresValidator didn't generate correct exception messages.
		 When the exception message didn't contain additional information, the 'condition' was used, but
		 wasn't concatenated with a dot. This resulted in a sentence without a dot.
		 
		-Several string methods threw an exception with an invalid exception message.
		 Methods 'StartsWith', 'DoesNotStartWith', 'Contains', 'DoesNotContain', 'EndsWith' and 
		 'DoesNotEndWith' threw an exception message like this: 
			"value does not contain {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'}"
		 The message should have been formed as follows:
			"value does not contain 'hello'"
	
	Code changes:
		-Overload methods added with a 'conditionDescription' parameter of type string for all extension 
		methods and unit tests added to support these new overloads.
		
		-[BREAKING CHANGE] The public Validator<T>.ArgumentName field is changed to a read only property.
		 This property was designed as field to ensure the best performance. However, the value is exclusively
		 used in exceptional cases (when exceptions are thrown). Therefore, violating the Framework Design
		 Guidelines wasn't a valid excuse.
		 
		-Extra 'IsTrue' and 'IsFalse' methods added according to work item 7143.
		 These method overloads allow validating Boolean and Nullable<Boolean> values.
		 see http://www.codeplex.com/conditions/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7143 for this work item.		 
		 
		-Extra method overloads added for most primitive CLR types to increase performance.
		 Method overloads for Byte, DateTime, Decimal, Double, Int16, Int32, Int64 and Single added for the
		 methods in the 'Compare' group. You could expect a 50% performance improvement on average, when
		 the new overloads are used (no code has to be changed, just recompile).
		 
		-Validation<T> class is now extendable.
		 Developers can now inherit from Validator<T>. This allows them to define other entry point methods
		 (like Requires() and Ensures()) that integrate with the existing extension methods.
		 
		-Otherwise<TException> method overloads added.
		 The Validation<T> class now has two instance methods that return an internal 
		 OtherwiseValidator<T, TUncheckedException> class. These two overloads allow the user to specify
		 a custom exception to be thrown, because Requires and Ensures only allow ArgumentException and
		 PostconditionException to be thrown.
		 
		-Evaluate(bool condition, string description) overload added according to work item 7469.
		 see: http://www.codeplex.com/conditions/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7469
		 
	Changes to project and solutions:
		-Unused references removed from CuttingEdge.Conditions project.
		 The only references that are used by the project are System and System.Core. Others are removed.
		 
		-Release build of CuttingEdge.Conditions project doesn't build a .pdb file anymore.
		 Loosing the .pdb file enables developers to have a local copy of the project on their machine, and
		 include the release build of CuttingEdge.Conditions.dll to their own project, without jumping into
		 CuttingEdge.Conditions' source code every time a precondition validation failed.
